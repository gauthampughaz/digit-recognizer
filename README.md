# Digit Recognizer
Although this is a computer vision problem, I created a simple model using **K-Nearest Neighbors** algorithm in this notebook to be a good starting point knowing that CNN would be a much better option. I used the **GridSearchCV** to fine tune the hyperparameters such as *"n_neighbors", and "weights"* and to perform cross-validation. Furthermore, I have used **Data Augmentation** or **Artificial Data Synthesis** technique in this notebook to boost the model's performance on the test set.
